            <td><h1> Review </h1><h2>Forget Disney! We have movies like Your Name.</h2><h3>Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!

            <td><h1> Review  </h1><h2>Another incredible film from Makoto Shinkai </h2><h3>Suzume finds writer/director Makoto Shinkai exploring all the expected elements that make him an auteur with another stunning film that combines jaw dropping spectacle with an emotionally resonant story, this time about facing repressed trauma that's very specific to its country of origin.  Nanoka Hara is terrific as Suzume, funny confident and has really good chemistry with Hokuto Matsumura, who still manages to bring plenty of gravitas when looking like a three legged chair. Ann Yamane is extremely adorable as Daijin, a character with mysterious motivations but is impossible to hate.</h3></td>
            <td><h1> Review  </h1><h2>Saw this movie on a airplane. </h2><h3>I was flying back from Japan to Belgium (long flight) . So, i was browsing the movies they had on the airplane. ..... ..... .... I Want to Eat Your Pancreas .... .... Hell yeah! I'm a big horror fan! So the title immediately caught my attention! I was immediately convinced, so without reading what the film was about I started this adventure. ... .... Ooh boy! I think sometimes it's good to know nothing about the movie when you first see it! Because otherwise i would never have seen this movie.</h3></td>
                </td>
            <td><h1> Review  </h1><h2>Hyouka; aka patiently waiting for the second season, which will never come. </h2><h3> I really like the work of Kyoto Animation. Unique and fantastic art style, perfect music and even more perfect stories. Hyouka almost has all of them. Or to be more precise, it had the potential to have all them.

                The plot is nothing complex: Oreki Houtarou, our first main character is an energy-conservative guy, who has to join the 'Classics Club'. He meets our other main character, Chitanda Eru, who is tireless and very, very, very curious. Thanks to this ever-curious girl, Oreki is dragged into many mysteries and investigations, which is, of course, the complete opposite of the boy's lifestyle.</td>
